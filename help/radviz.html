<div class="header">Definition</div>
Radial visualization of data points from m-dimensional space into a plane.<br>
m reference points are arranged equally spaced around the circumference of the circle. Each data point is placed within the circle such a virtual spring connects it to each reference points. The stiffness of the i-th spring is proportional to the i-th coordinate of the data point. The data point is placed where the resulting force of all the springs is equal to zero.

<div class="header">Parameters</div>
In the right slots, the numerical fields used as dimensions of the data points<br>
In the left slot, an optional categorical field used to color the points.<br>
In the right slot, an optional categorical field used to label the points.<br>

<div class="header">Actions</div>
Drag a numerical field to the graph to change its unit. The points will be represented as bubbles of size proportional to the numerical value.<br>
