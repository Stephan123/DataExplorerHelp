<div class="header">Definition</div>
There are two set of variables. We look for a linear combination of variables from the first set with maximum correlation with a linear combination of variables of the second set. This is the canonical factor 1.<br>
We then look for factor 2 orthogonal (not correlated) with factor 1.<br>

<div class="header">Parameters</div>
In the right top slots, the quantitative fields of the first set.<br>
In the right bottom slots, the quantitative fiels of the second set.<br>
At least two fields must be specified in each set, that is a minimum of
four fields is needed.<br>

<div class="header">Options</div>
Option 1: Representation of the data points in the cartesian coordinate system of the canonical factors of the first set.<br>

Option 2: Representation of the data points in the cartesian coordinate system of the canonical factors of the second set.<br>

Option 3: Circle of correlation of the variables with the canonical factors of the first set.<br>

Option 4: Circle of correlation of the variables with the canonical factors of the second set.<br>

Option 5: Percentage of inertia (variance) on each axis.<br>
