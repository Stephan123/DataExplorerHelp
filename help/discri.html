<div class="header">Definition</div>
The first two factors , linear combination of the original variables, that best separate  the categories
of the qualitative field, are computed<br>
Then the data points are represented in the cartesian coordinate system of these two factors.<br>
For each group, the ellipses show the points at Mahalanobis distance 0.5, 1,
1.5 and 2 from the center of the group.<br>

<div class="header">Parameters</div>
In the right slots, the quantitative fields used as coordinates of the data points.<br>
In the left slot, the  qualitative field used to class the data points.<br>
In the right slot, an optional qualitative field used to label the points.<br>

<div class="header">Options</div>
Option 1: data points in the cartesian coordinate system of the first two factors.<br>
Option 2: circle of correlation of the variables with the first two factors.<br>
Option 3: histogram of the eigenvalues, i.e. the parts of variance explained by the factors.<br>

<div class="header">Actions</div>
Drag a numerical field to the graph to change its unit. The points will be represented as bubbles of size proportional to the numerical value.<br>
