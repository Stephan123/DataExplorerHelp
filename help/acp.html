<div class="header">Definition</div>

Convert a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated principal components.<br>
The represention of the data points  in the cartesian coordinate system of the first two principal components separates at best the data points.<br>
<br>

<div class="header">Parameters</div>
In the right slots, the list of numerical fields to be part of the analysis.<br>
In the bottom slot, an optional categorical field to color the points.<br>
In the right slot, an optional categorical field used to label the points.<br>

<div class="header">Options</div>
Option 1: the data points in the plane of the first two principal components.<br>
Option 2: the correlation circle in the plane of the first two components.<br>
Option 3: the histogram of the eagenvalues, showing the proportion of the variance explained by each component.<br>

<div class="header">Actions</div>
Drag a numerical field to the graph to change its unit. The points will be represented as bubbles of size proportional to the numerical value.<br>
