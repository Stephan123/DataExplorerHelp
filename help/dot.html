Circular graphic, divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.<br>
The origin of the graphic is at the top (twelve o'clock). The slices are ordered clockwise, by decreasing size.<br>
As it is difficult to compare different slices, this representation should be used only when comparing the slices to the total.<br>

<div class="header">Parameters</div>
